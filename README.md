# Setup

The solutions and tests can run as-is. However, you can run the solution using the input from Advent of Code as well by doing the following before running the solutions:
- Access the Day 1 problem at https://adventofcode.com/2023.
- In the `input.txt` file in the repo, replace the text with the input from the Day 1 problem

Once the answers for part 1 and 2 have been calculate, you can complete the following steps so that the test that involves the correct answer will pass:
- Once the answer for part 1 has been calculated, copy-paste the answer into the `test_part_1_answer.txt` file in the `tests` folder
- Once the answer for part 2 has been calculated, copy-paste the answer into the `test_part_2_answer.txt` file in the `tests` folder
